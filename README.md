# Project1

We are creating our first project called Tattoo4U.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate being collaborative and to use GIT in a collaborative way with multiple branches.

We will also be demonstrating the skills that we have learned over the time we have been in the course.

Our project idea is that we are going to target a certain area locally and pull from yelp and instagram tattoo shops within that area.

The api's will also be used to reference pictures of the location reviews and possibly portfolio pictures.

We wanted to make it easy for people to be able to locate shops based on the "style" that they are interested in.

Alot of people that want a tattoo do not know how to properly research who is right to do the tattoo. 

Just like how a doctor is a specialist in a field so is a tattoo artist. For example if we are telling a heart doctor to do brain surgery

we probably will not get the best outcome.

The goal of this project is to be able to link the user based on style choice to a shop that has an artist that specializes in that category.

Some of the things that we are going to show in our results category will be:

    Ratings (stars)
    Location (map jpeg)
    Reviews (first 3 reviews from yelp)
    Artist name and handle to IG.(favicon link)
