# Project1 - Tattoo4U

We are creating our first project called Tattoo4U.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate being collaborative and to use GIT in a collaborative way with multiple branches.

We will also be demonstrating the skills that we have learned over the time we have been in the course.

We wanted to make it easy for people to be able to locate tattoo shops based on the "style" that they are interested in.

Alot of people that want a tattoo do not know how to properly research who is right to do the tattoo. So we want to provide review and comment information so that it's easy for the user to see. 

Just like how a doctor is a specialist in a field so is a tattoo artist. 

Our project idea is that we are going to target a certain local areas to pull shops from Yelp. Since Yelp doesn't include a field for tattoo "style", we are going to simulate that functionality using Firebase to store objects and randomly assign style categories to each object. 

From the Yelp API we will get:
- Basic info like shop name, address, phone
- Rating Stars
- Number of reviews and 3 comments
- images from the shop

We are using the MapQuest API (GoogleMaps charges) to show mapped location info.

We are using Firebase to store our own "API" information. 

We also included:
- some image anime
- data validation to make sure users select the location and style
- Go Back and Start Over functionality
- Modals instead of pop-ups

On the collaboration front, we have met in the classroom, at a home, and via Zoom. We had a few problems with github in the beginning, but definiley improved over time. We used github's Issues feature heavily as well as the "kanban" area. Of course we also used Slack for communicating. Additionally, we all scheduled time with our tutors.
